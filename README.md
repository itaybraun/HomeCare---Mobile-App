# HomeCare---Mobile-App
This repository contains an application for Microsoft Open Source FHIR Server.
It is designed for FHIR 4 in general but we have homecare patients in mind. Therefore, the app focuses on managing ServiceRequests at different times and locations assigned to visiting nurses (Practitioners).

The application allows users to:
Use Azure AD authentication to log in securely  
View the planned ServiceRequests on a calendar and reschedule the task.  
View the ServiceRequest details: patient name, practitioner, what to do, when...  
Mark a Service Request as completed. The user may need to send a questionnaire to the system (using ActivityDetails) in order to complete the task.  
The form can also contain images (Media).  
View the details of the patient. View the completed tasks (ServiceRequest) associated with this patient, including the form filled when the task was submitted.   
View open tasks associated with the Patient.   
Manage Settings
